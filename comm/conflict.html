                She stated a truth. I feel that I lived an entire day without you. I agreed.
                She stated another truth I feel like you put other things as a higher priority than me.
                I probed for understanding by asking “Why do you feel that way.”
                She said that when I’m given the choice to sleep longer or spend time with her I choose sleep.
                She waited for a while but having a little bit of experience I waited more.
                She then continued by saying I feel that every time we resolve this issue of putting things before me you replace it with something else.

                She brought up that before I would choose to do homework instead of spending time with her.
                She also brought up that before I would want to watch movies instead of spend time talking with her.
                She then stated that I know that you dropped classes for me and that you have not used any media since then but I feel that it is the same problem and that is why I am bringing it up.
