   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;

   <p>
       Hot topic does a great job at proximity. The more things are related to each other the
       Closer they are on the web page. As you can see here all of the sales or advertisements
       Are found in the same area one after the other. As you go farther down the page and farther away from these advertisements you see unrelated elements that are separated by whitespace. For example at the bottom there are customer service tabs, and fanpics. Not only do they use whitespace to properly execute proximity design principles but they also use a grid to separate new ideas. All in all Hot topic follows the principle of proximity.

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;

   <p>
       Hot topic is one of the website that  provides a good design for alignment. As we see on the navigation bar, there is a rectangle bar that matches we the one below. The first time I look at this website my eyes focus on the top of the page which provide the information for the page. After that my eyes scroll down, and I can see the dresses that are provided. The dresses are provided side by side. There is also space between the two dresses. I really like that part because my eyes tend to follow down through the space between and it’s easier for me to look at the site.

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   <p>
       Repetition is one of the most common visual effects on Hot Topic’s web site. The repetitive phrase “Shop Now” is appearing under each advertisement picture on the site. This effect emphasizes the purpose of the web site to sell variety of products. Another interesting fact is the choice of font and colors for this “Shop Now” button. It is in small neutral white color that doesn’t make a viewer annoyed by this repetition. But it still provides a perfect reminder that the main reason of visiting this site is shopping.

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;

   </h3>

   <p>
       Hot Topic's home page utilizes an effective use of contrast through size, color, and movement.  First, is movement. There is a flashing text that informs us that today there is a sale. It is moving/flashing, so catches the viewer's eye first. Then is the 25% off on the first big image. This text is the biggest on the page, and therefore where the eye travels to next. And finally, the color contrast is in the bright, saturated red text in both of the before listed elements. Both texts are contrasted by the black background behind them.

   <h3>Typography &mdash;

   </h3>

   <p>
       Since Hot Topic started out as mainly a rock band music website, it has a gothic font style for its title “Hot Topic”. The rock bandish theme influences the colors of the website because it mainly uses black background and with its main logo in white and some texts in red. This eases the eye in reading the texts on the website. Aside from their main logos and titles, the other texts on the website varies because the Hot Topic has spread into more entertainment sectors of movies, music and pop culture in general. Therefore, they tend to use the original font style of the product they are advertising or that is on their site. You may find varying font styles throughout the site.
